Build a simple TODO application using vanilla javascript. The application should allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Can you code it using best industry practice like modularity, clean code etc.

Approach that needs to followed

1. Plan out the user interface and decide on the features you want to implement (e.g., adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, etc.)

2. Set up your HTML file with the necessary structure and elements, such as input fields, buttons, and lists.

3. Create a separate JavaScript file and start by defining the UI elements you will be using, such as the form, input, and list elements.

4. Write a function to add a new task to the list when the user submits the form. This function should create a new list item and add it to the list.

5. Write a function to mark a task as complete when the user clicks on it. This function should toggle a "completed" class on the task element.

6. Write a function to delete a task from the list when the user clicks on the delete button. This function should remove the task element from the list.

7. Add event listeners to the form, task elements, and delete buttons to call the appropriate functions when the user interacts with the UI.

8. Refactor your code to improve modularity, readability, and maintainability. Consider separating your code into different modules or functions that each  handle a specific task or responsibility.

9. Add any additional features or improvements to your TODO application, such as sorting tasks, filtering tasks, or adding due dates.

By following this plan, you should be able to create a clean and modular TODO application using vanilla JavaScript that is easy to maintain and extend.
